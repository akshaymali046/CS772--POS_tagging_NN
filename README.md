## Description

This project focuses on part-of-speech (POS) tagging, a fundamental task in natural language processing. We explore the use of an encoder-decoder architecture along with a feedforward neural network (FFNN) to tackle this challenge. Our aim is to develop an efficient and accurate POS tagging system that can assign appropriate POS labels to words in a given text, aiding in various downstream NLP applications.

## Technologies and Tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch, sci-kit-learn, NLTK
- Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook

## Project Overview
In this project, we aim to develop a robust part-of-speech (POS) tagging system using a combination of advanced neural network architectures. POS tagging involves assigning grammatical categories (such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to each word in a given text. This is a crucial task in natural language processing, with applications ranging from language translation to information retrieval.

## Methodology
- Data Preparation: We start by acquiring a suitable dataset for training and evaluation. The dataset should include annotated text samples with corresponding POS tags. We will preprocess the text data by tokenizing and converting words to numerical representations.

- Encoder-Decoder Architecture: We will implement an encoder-decoder architecture, which has proven effective in sequence-to-sequence tasks. The encoder will encode the input text, and the decoder will generate the POS tags sequentially. This architecture can capture complex dependencies between words and their corresponding POS tags.

- Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN): As a complement to the encoder-decoder, we will also experiment with a feedforward neural network. This model could take advantage of local word-context information to predict POS tags.
